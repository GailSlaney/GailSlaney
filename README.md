# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
A little about me...
I used to work as a software developer and then moved into the oil & gas industry. Most recently, I have been updating my tech skills with the coaches at Get Coding and preparing to get back into the fun world of programming.

I have a Bachelor of Science degree from Memorial University, as well as a Programmer Analyst Business Diploma from the College of the North Atlantic. 

I live in Paradise where I enjoy practicing yoga, curling, and walking my Gordon setter.
